## Why we chose MongoDB

1. We used MongoDB because its document storage format is a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). This format aligns with NestJS's use of JavaScript and JSON serialization, allowing us to store and retrieve JSON-like records without complex normalization. This compatibility simplifies data integration.

2. MongoDB offers schema flexibility, which is crucial for our data. For example, data like drug descriptions can contain varying lengths and content. Additionally, MongoDB can handle large amounts of data efficiently.

3. MongoDB provides an ODM (Object Document Mapping) that offers functionality to perform CRUD operations, making it easier to work with the database.
